üöÄ Hackathon 3 Day 2: Laying the Technical Foundation

Hackathons are about innovation and turning visions into reality! On Day 2 of Hackathon 3, I focused on establishing a solid technical foundation for our Marketplace Project. Here's an overview of what I achieved:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Organized a Comprehensive Documentation System

Set up a well-structured .docs folder that includes:

System Architecture Visualizations: Clear illustrations of how the frontend connects with the backend.
Data Schema Designs: Precise diagrams for defining and managing the database.
Detailed API References: Comprehensive guidelines for API interactions, including integration with Sanity CMS.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Frontend and Backend Integration

Established a seamless interaction between the frontend and Sanity CMS to ensure APIs operate efficiently and deliver reliable results.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Defined User Interaction Flow

Created detailed workflows and visual diagrams to map user interactions with the platform, streamlining the user journey and simplifying technical implementation.
